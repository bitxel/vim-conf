# VIM conf for server

This vim configuration file is based on [ma6174/vim](https://github.com/ma6174/vim). This version resemble conf files, seperate it into server conf and user conf, remove some useless and duplicated options.

### Server Configuration

Extra plugins is redundant for server side VIM, so branch `server` is a VIM with basic configurations.

```
git clone -b server https://github.com/bitxel/vim-conf.git
```

### Desktop Configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/bitxel/vim-conf.git
```
