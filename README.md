# VIM conf for server and desktop use

This vim configuration file is based on [ma6174/vim](https://github.com/ma6174/vim). This version resembles conf files, seperates it into server conf and desktop conf, removes some useless and duplicated options.

### Server Configuration

Extra plugins is redundant for server side VIM, so branch `server` is a VIM with basic configurations.

```
git clone -b server https://github.com/bitxel/vim-conf.git ~/
```

### Desktop Configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/bitxel/vim-conf.git ~/
```
